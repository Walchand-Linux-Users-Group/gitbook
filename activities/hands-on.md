Knowledge is just a group of facts until we understand the topic and its inner workings, and this knowledge can be achieved through various sources. Understanding and gaining knowledge of the topic from ocean of sources and tracing finest parts of i can be difficult and time consuming.&#x20;

We gather in the classroom learn and understand, discuss and the end test our understanding making us thorough in the topic.
