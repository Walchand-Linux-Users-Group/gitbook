# ðŸ“„ Blog

We believe writing is a skill that one should build to survive in this era as we barely interact with each other face to face. Convincing reader and feeding our content to the curiousity of reader in smooth flow is a thing to learn from practicing and reading literature.

We generally publish blog week or biweekly depending on academic plan and other factors. We support non-WLUGians to write a blog and contribute us. But we have some Inevitable and strong guidelines that writers must follow and will be verified by Editors.
