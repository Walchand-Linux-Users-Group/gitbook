# ðŸ“„ Blog

We believe writing is a skill that one should build to survive in this era as we barely interact with each other face to face. Convincing reader and feeding our content to the curiosity of reader in smooth flow is a thing to learn from practicing and reading literature.

We generally publish blog week or biweekly depending on academic plan and other factors. We support non-WLUGians to write a blog and contribute us. But we have some Inevitable and strong guidelines that writers must follow and will be verified by Editors.

### Writer's Guidelines

* [ ] Blog should start with a quote.
* [ ] Name of writers should link to their Github Profile.
* [ ] No content of the blog should be copied from any other source and should be plagiarism free.
* [ ] Images should be crystal-clear and of higher quality and should attribute to its origin.
* [ ] Redundant links that occur random in blog should be removed.
