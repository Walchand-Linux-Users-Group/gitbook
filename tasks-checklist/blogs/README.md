**What is Blog?**

A blog, a shortened version of “weblog” is **an online journal or informational website** displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.



#### _What is the purpose of a blog?_

The main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant Open Source topic and throws a good deal of light on your existing knowledge.
