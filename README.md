# Walchand Linux Users' Group 🤝 Gitbook

### Guidelines:

1. Each branch maps to a space on Gitbook.

2. Do not merge any branches(already protected using Github branch rules).

3. Do not update sub-domains connected to spaces as they are interlinked and can cause errors.

4. We recommend Gitbook UI to update the content. 

5. Main branch is not being used by Gitbook, so if assets related to gitbook can be stored on main branch 🎉
