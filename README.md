# 🐧 Walchand Linux Users' Group Wiki

Walchand Linux Users' Group is a community of open source promoting students from Walchand College of Engineering established in 2003 i.e almost legacy of 20 years 🥳.&#x20;

We as a community strive for getting grip on various technologies and build a bridge that would take junior students to another dimension of understanding and adapting technical skills.

This wiki will take you through what Walchand Linux Users' Group does.
