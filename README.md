# Walchand Linux Users' Group 🤝 Gitbook

### Guidelines:

1. Each branch refers a space on Gitbook.

2. Do not merge any branch to any other branch(already protected using Github branch rules).

3. Do not update sub-domains connected to spaces as they are interlinked and can cause errors.

4. We recommend Gitbook UI to update the content. 

5. Main branch is not being used by Gitbook 🎉
